# Internet-and-Web-Technology-Lab
This Repository is all about the popular Internet and Web Technology Lab concepts and their variations, which can help design a website. I have to try the Internet and Web Technology for all problem solutions.

Internet and web technology refers to the tools, protocols, and infrastructure used for connecting computers and creating websites and web applications.

The Internet is a global network of computers that allows for exchanging information and communication between devices. It comprises servers, routers, and other networking equipment that transmit data using protocols such as TCP/IP.

Web technology, on the other hand, specifically refers to the technologies used to create and access websites and web applications. It includes programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and server-side languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby. These technologies create web pages' structure, design, and interactivity.

Web technology also encompasses the tools and frameworks used to build websites and web applications. These include content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal and web development frameworks like React, Angular, and Ruby on Rails.

In addition to website development, web technology includes other Internet-based technologies such as email, file transfer protocol (FTP), and cloud computing. It also encompasses security protocols and measures to protect data and ensure secure transactions, such as encryption, SSL/TLS, and firewalls.

Overall, the Internet and web technology enable the creation, access, and communication of information and services on the World Wide Web, making it an essential part of modern life and business.
